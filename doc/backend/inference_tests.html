class EULATest:
  &#34;&#34;&#34;
  This class parametrizes a test of the deep learning module with a single EULA agreement. 
  It accepts an inference engine, eula text, as well as the true ethicality of the agreement.
  It then runs a small set of tests relating to the neural networks&#39; accuracy, 
  as well as some basic sanity checks.

  Args:
    inference_engine (inference.Inference): the associated inference engine to run the tests with
    text (str): a EULA text to run the test on
    ethicality (str): either &#39;ethical&#39; or &#39;unethical&#39;, the target value for the current EULA text

    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    This test takes as input some text and calls the summarizer code.
    It ensures that there are no runtime errors in the summarization pipeline and 
    that the returned summary is shorter than the input text, given that the input
    text is big enough.

  def classifier_test(self):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    This test takes as input some text and calls the ethicality classifier.
    It checks if the classifier correctly classifies a EULA as ethical or unethical.
    Since the classifier is stochastic, this does not perform assertions and is
    NOT guaranteed to succeed.
